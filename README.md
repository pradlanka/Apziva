## [Project 5: ValueInvestor [Q9MwvUueFZ02RjAH]](https://github.com/pradlanka/Apziva/tree/main/Q9MwvUueFZ02RjAH)

### Introduction/Background
The goal is to develop an intelligent system that aids in our value-investing efforts using historical stock market data. Specifically, we aim to predict stock price valuations on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to inform our BUY, HOLD, and SELL decisions. The challenge is to maximize capital returns, minimize losses, and reduce the HOLD period while using intrinsic value principles.

### Data Description
The dataset comprises trading data of 8 portfolio companies from emerging markets from 8 countries, including stock prices for 2020 Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and 2021 Q1. Each companyâ€™s stock data is provided in different sheets, reflecting varying operating days based on the country and market in which the stocks are traded. For this project, we will use only the 2020 data to predict with the 2021 Q1 data.

### Goal(s)
The primary goal is to predict stock price valuations on a daily basis. Based on these predictions, we will recommend BUY, HOLD, or SELL decisions to maximize capital returns and minimize losses. Ideally, the goal is to avoid any losses and minimize the HOLD period for stocks.

### Methodology
#### ARIMA Models
- Used ARIMA model to forecast the next day's closing stock price.
- Identified model order using differencing and statistical tests (ADF, KPSS, ACF, PACF).
- Checked for seasonality using Fourier transform; no significant peaks found.
- Optimal model order determined with auto.arima function.
- Extended to ARIMAX model, including exogenous variables (previous day's opening price, high, low, percentage change, stock volume, and USD exchange rate).
- Achieved best performance with ARIMAX model.

#### Trading Strategy
- Employed Bollinger Bands and custom buy-hold-sell logic to optimize trading decisions.
- Bollinger Bands calculated using moving average and standard deviations to identify potential buy and sell signals.
- Strategy buys stocks when the price crosses the lower Bollinger Band and meets a specified threshold.
- Sells stocks if the price drops below a set stop-loss level and exceeds the upper Bollinger Band with a sufficient margin or if the holding period exceeds a maximum limit.
- Aims to maximize returns, minimize losses, and optimize the holding period.

### Results
- Implemented strategy with ARIMAX and Block LSTM models, achieving average returns of USD 1024 and USD 1051, respectively, from an initial investment of USD 1000 in each company, i.e., an annualized ROI of 10 and 21%.
